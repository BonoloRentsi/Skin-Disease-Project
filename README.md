# Skin-Disease-Project

The Skin Disease Detection project uses patient information and visual characteristics of images of different skin conditions to group the images into seven distinct skin diseases.  It includes using an already existing computer model that was trained with the Image_Net dataset on how to differentiate a variety range of features and patterns from the Skin Disease dataset.  The use of models such as the ResNet50, DenseNet201, XceptionNet, and CNN are focused upon in this project, and the advantages that the pre-trained models allow are fully utilized to serve the purpose of this project.  Using the Skin dataset, all the models including CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) are trained, and new external images are used to test whether the models can identify the type of skin disease from the image correctly.  
The sole purpose of this project is to create a solution for the classification and diagnosis of existing skin diseases ultimately reducing the cost of dermatologists' prices and allowing equal access to affordable health care.  The key outcomes of this project are solutions such as research findings into the medical industry and computer framework solutions to assist patients with different skin conditions, accurately and faster.  The project could serve as a guide for the research community on where to continue, and for the medical community, it could serve as a revolutionary pack on the use of computers to diagnose skin conditions.
